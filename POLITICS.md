# Social goals of react-useintersection

The `IntersectionObserver` api is a powerful JavaScript construct. The author of this package intends for it to help facilitate:

1. Accessible UX design
Programmatically determing the intersection of nodes with the screen gives powerful flexibility to control styling and layout.

2. Wider understanding of advanced JavaScript apis by helping them be more easily used in the React framework
The `IntersectionObserver` api is but one of several Observer apis in JavaScript, most of which are in the author's opinion relatively unknown to the average programmer because there is a lack of high level packages for them in frameworks such as React.
