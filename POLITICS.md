## Social goals of react-useintersection

The `IntersectionObserver` api is a powerful JavaScript construct. The author of this package intends for it to help facilitate:

1. **Accessible UX design:** Programmatically determining the intersection of nodes with the screen gives powerful flexibility to control styling and layout.

2. **Wider understanding of advanced JavaScript apis:** The `IntersectionObserver` api is but one of several Observer apis in JavaScript, most of which are in the author's opinion relatively unknown to the average programmer because there is a lack of high level packages for them in frameworks such as React.
